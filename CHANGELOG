* v0.5.1    UNRELEASED

- A recent change on Emacs 27.0.50 causes an EmacSQL bug to surface.
  That was fixed upstream and the dependency was bumped to bring in
  that fix.

* v0.5.0    2017/11/27

- Emacs 26.1 will use a new ~record~ type instead of vectors.
  Closql can now deal with both internal representations.

* v0.4.0    2017/09/19

- The value of a slot can now be a list of objects.  Like for a slot
  whose value is a list of lists, the elements have to be uniform, in
  this case they have to share a base-class, and they are unordered.

  Objects in such secondary tables can be queried directly, using the
  same functions that are used to query objects in the primary table.
  For secondary tables the new optional ~class~ argument of these query
  functions has to be provided.

  Note that ~oset~ currently does not support "list of objects" slots.

- Access information is now stored in slots of the object base class
  instead of in the database class.  This change was necessary to
  allow storing objects of different types in different tables.

  The names of all of these slots are prefixed with ~closql-~.  The
  existing slot ~database~ was renamed to ~closql-database~ and the slot
  property ~:columns~ was renamed to ~:closql-columns~.

- Class tags are now automatically abbreviated when being stored in
  the database because that gives friendlier results when querying it
  direct.

  It was already possible to do that before by implementing the
  generic functions ~closql--class-to-sql~ and ~closql--sql-to-class~.
  These functions were replaced by the functions ~closql--abbrev-class~
  and ~closql--expand-abbrev~, which have different signatures and allow
  subclasses to strip a common prefix and/or suffix by setting the
  object slots ~closql-class-prefix~ and ~closql-class-suffix~ instead of
  having to define methods for these subclasses.

- Added new functions ~closql-query~.  It calls either ~closql-entries~
  or if its ~select~ argument is non-nil ~closql-select~.  If ~select~ is a
  symbol, then return a list of elements, unlike ~closql-select~, which
  would return a list of lists with one element each.

- The function ~closql--where-class-in~ isn't merely intended for
  internal use anymore and was renamed to ~closql-where-in-class~.

- Added new internal function ~closql--list-subbrevs~.

- The internal function ~closql--oref-default~ was removed.

- The function signature of ~closql--remake-instance~ changed.

* v0.3.3    2016/12/31

- Repository moved to https://github.com/emacscollective/closql.

* v0.3.2    2016/11/26

- Update links.

* v0.3.1    2016/11/03

- Fixed updating of rows in secondary tables when the key is ~nil~.

* v0.3.0    2016/10/25

- Setting the value of a slot whose value is stored in a secondary
  table no longer deletes and recreates all rows.

- ~closql--db-init~ no longer sets the primary key of secondary tables.

* v0.2.0    2016/09/02

- Text properties are now being removed when storing string in the
  database.

* v0.1.0    2016/04/15

- Initial public alpha release.
